On a semi-recent business trip to Silicon Valley, I noticed that some executives
really liked the term **"CRUSHING IT"**. That's a term we don't hear in the open
source community. [Dan Abramov's](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) Flux
alternative [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux/) has recently surpassed all
other Flux alternatives, and
[react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) has also achieved a high
level of visibility in the React community. They *could* certainly say they are
*crushing it* but the *open source way* is the exact **opposite!**

Through the involvement of the open source community, we're creating a massively
bigger pie rather than trying to get a bigger slice of the pie. Consequently,
all who participate are "winning." There are no loser in open source. Just
growth for all involved.

This mentality of winning, sadly, starts off early for most youngsters. Teachers
grade on a bell curve. On the playground, kids play sports to "win". Have you
ever seen hyper-competitive little league parents? You have to beat your peers
on college entrance exams to get into the right university. Then you have to
compete for grades and jobs. Personally, I grew up with the pressure I had to be
a pro level tennis player, "in order to get into the right college", besides
achieving perfect grades!

Then the college grad goes into corporate America and learn the meaning of
[Stack Ranking](http://qz.com/320532/marissa-mayers-yahoo-is-a-case-study-in-the-toxic-nature-of-stack-ranking/).
I've been in groups when the manager of can only give out a single "1"
performance ranking, and has to give out a few "3's", where "1" means amazing,
and "3" means you're being given a "performance plan", which really means "we're
firing you and we don't want you to sue us." It's probably not surprising that
this same stack-ranking company also deterred open source contributions. At this
company, contributing to any open source project without 3 levels of management
approval was grounds for firing! *Tip: don't work for such companies.*

At ShakaCode, we're all about making a bigger pie! There's no good or bad or
code, and there's no fears of having your team members criticize your code.
Instead, we're all about the open source way of taking great pride in our
craftsmanship and helping team members do better. Everything we do is based on
open source, and we're doing our best to make meaningful contributions back to
the community. I'd say our biggest accomplishment in this area is our new Ruby
Gem, [react_on_rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails), which
provides a complete system for integrating React, Webpack, and the entire NPM
ecosystem into Rails apps.

Our hiring reflects our philosophy. We don't torture job candidates with
programming stress tests. Instead, we try to work with them on open source just
as we would after they are hired. This fits into our **remote first**
philosophy. Basically, if you can contribute meaningfully to open source in the
Ruby and JavaScript worlds, then you'll fit right in with us, regardless of
where you're located or whether or not you can solve humiliating programming
puzzles in record time. We don't monitor our team members. Instead we trust them
to make the right decisions and to act with integrity.

## Side Note: Surfing FTW!

David Hanson loves car racing. Many of us at ShakaCode love surfing and other
outdoor action sports.

The joy of surfing is akin to car racing this respect. Every day one goes
surfing, the primary battle is to become **connected to the energy of the
ocean**. It challenges you both at the physical level, as you need strength and
agility to ride waves. It also challenges your judgment. Can you predict where
the next wave will break? Are you the surfer best positioned for the next wave?
What I love the most about surfing is the feeling that the learning process
never ends. A combination of strength, skill, and a connection to nature also
applies to other outdoor action sports such as snow boarding, mountain biking,
kite-surfing, windsurfing, paddling, etc

At ShakaCode, we're thrilled our team members have hobbies like surfing to
complement the intellectual vigor of writing code. Our business is a marathon,
not a sprint, and a healthy, long-term perspective is best for our team, our
clients, and our products.

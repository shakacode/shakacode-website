title: "For Happiness, Pursue Creative Expression, Not Winning"

What is the goal in life? Is it to "win"? Or is it "happiness"? I suggest a
focus on "winning" is counterproductive, compared to a focus on creativity,
collaboration, and giving. If your definition of "winning" *is* "happiness",
then the path is not by *defeating* others, but, instead, *helping* others!

Competitive sports is all around us. We cherish the winners and berate the
losers. It's part of America, right?

To quote [David Heinemeier Hanson](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/) in
[I don't want to be a winner](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3977-i-dont-want-to-be-a-winner):

> Is there anything our society exalts more than The Winner? That fiery someone
> who crushes all competition to stand alone and victorious at the end. A
> genetic predisposition, I’m sure.

> The paradigm of competition is so ingrained as the basic business narrative

> course there are winners and losers! What are you, a fucking communist?!

The importance of winning, sadly, starts off early for most youngsters. On the
playground, kids play sports to "win". Have you ever seen hyper-competitive
little league parents? "If you're not a winner, then you're a **LOOSER**!

In high school, you have to beat your peers to get the best grades, and then
have to beat them on college entrance exams to get into the right university.
Winning jocks are idolized.

This continues into college, where you have to compete for grades and jobs.
Personally, I grew up with the pressure I had to be a pro level tennis player,
"in order to get into the right college", besides achieving perfect grades!

The college grad may then go into corporate America and learn the meaning of
[Stack Ranking](http://qz.com/320532/marissa-mayers-yahoo-is-a-case-study-in-the-toxic-nature-of-stack-ranking/).
I've been in groups when the manager of can only give out a single "1"
performance ranking, and has to give out a few "3's", where "1" means amazing,
and "3" means you're being given a "performance plan", which really means "we're
firing you and we don't want you to sue us." It's probably not surprising that
this same stack-ranking company also deterred open source contributions. At this
company, contributing to any open source project without 3 levels of management
approval was grounds for firing! *Tip: don't work for such companies.*

I can say from direct personal experience, looking a my success in companies
where I competed against my peers, versus a focus on simply collaborating and
giving away best in the open source world. My biggest mistake is that I put up
with this environment way too long.

[Laird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton) is as much a legend in the
surfing world as David is in the programming and start up worlds. He could have
competed in professional surfing. Instead, he chose to forge his own path,
rather than being bound by the judging standards of competitive surfing. In a
recent interview in the
[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/laird-hamilton-competition_55d4fe27e4b055a6dab2d7b5),
he stated:

While Laird is all about surfing, his comments also apply to world of **open
source collaboration**:

> “A creative man is fulfilled by accomplishments and a competitive man is
> fulfilled by beating others," Hamilton said, paraphrasing an old saying. He
> continued, "I’m all about accomplishments. Ride the biggest wave. It has to do
> with me. I can always grow and keep accomplishing things.”

> This insistence on competing only with himself is a survival mechanism of
> sorts -- or an almost spiritual life philosophy. “I wanted to be in control. I
> wanted to be the one determining if I felt fulfilled or not,” Hamilton said.

Interestingly, David has a parallel to Laird in that he loves race car driving:

> The only competition I’ve come to love is the one against myself, and that’s
> not really a competition, now is it? The progress of betterment. Playing your
> part to the best of your abilities in a beautiful whole.

> That’s the joy I take away from racing cars for endurance. It’s not so much
> being faster than the other cars, but striving to perfect your own
> contribution as part of a team. Pushing against the limits of perfect
> execution over the long term. 24 hours of testing your capability to avoid
> mistake and fatigue. Winning is almost incidental to that.

What works for Laird, David, and me, regarding happiness, is to focus on
**creative expression**, be it in the waves, in writing, in software, or
wherever your passion lies. Forget about competition and beating others.
Instead, focus on what you can do to bring up and inspire others! We have to
focus on making bigger pies, and not getting just larger slices of a fixed pie,
as in "winners" and "losers". Open source is all about this grow the pie
collaboration, in contrast to the litigation brought on by patents and
copyrights.

I'm definitely on this page of the pursuit of creativity and collaboration,
rather than competition. For me, the joy of surfing is to compete with myself.
The primary goal is to become **connected to the energy of the ocean**. It
challenges you both at the physical level, as you need strength and agility to
ride waves. It also challenges your judgment. Can you predict where the next
wave will break? Are you the surfer best positioned for the next wave? What I
love the most about surfing is the feeling that the learning process never ends.
A combination of strength, skill, and a connection to nature also applies to
other outdoor action sports such as snow boarding, mountain biking,
kite-surfing, windsurfing, paddling, etc

At ShakaCode, we're all about making a bigger pie, through our open source work,
consulting, and products! There's no good or bad or code, and there's no fears
of having your team members criticize your code. Instead, we're all about the
open source way of taking great pride in our craftsmanship and helping team
members do better. Everything we do is based on open source, and we're doing our
best to make meaningful contributions back to the community. I'd say our biggest
accomplishment in this area is our new Ruby Gem,
[react_on_rails](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails), which provides a
complete system for integrating React, Webpack, and the entire NPM ecosystem
into Rails apps.

Our hiring reflects our philosophy. We don't torture job candidates with
programming stress tests. Instead, we try to work with them on open source just
as we would after they are hired. This fits into our **remote first**
philosophy. Basically, if you can contribute meaningfully to open source in the
Ruby and JavaScript worlds, then you'll fit right in with us, regardless of
where you're located or whether or not you can solve humiliating programming
puzzles in record time. We don't monitor our team members. Instead we trust them
to make the right decisions and to act with integrity.

By the way, at ShakaCode, we're thrilled our team members have hobbies like
surfing to complement the intellectual vigor of writing code. Our business is a
marathon, not a sprint, and a healthy, long-term perspective is best for our
team, our clients, and our products. And a flexible, remote-first work
environment is conducive to allowing our team members to live well balanced and
productive lives.
